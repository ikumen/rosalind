008_prot.py: Translating RNA into Protein (http://rosalind.info/problems/prot/)

Problem: The 20 commonly occurring amino acids are abbreviated by using 20 letters 
from the English alphabet (all letters except for B, J, O, U, X, and Z). Protein 
strings are constructed from these 20 symbols. Henceforth, the term genetic string 
will incorporate protein strings along with DNA strings and RNA strings.

The RNA codon table dictates the details regarding the encoding of specific codons 
into the amino acid alphabet.


Given: An RNA string ss corresponding to a strand of mRNA (of length at most 10 kbp).
Return: The protein string encoded by ss.
